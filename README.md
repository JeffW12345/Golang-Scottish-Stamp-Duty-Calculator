INTRODUCTION
============

This app calculates LBBT (essentially Scottish stamp duty - see https://revenue.scot/taxes/land-buildings-transaction-tax).

The calculations are done on a localhost server. The client obtains the tax amount for a property of a given value by making a GET request to 
the server's API.

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS
====================

Clone the repo. 

Navigate to the repo in a command terminal. Then type the following:

go mod download

Change the figure in the 'DisplayTaxDueForProperty' method call in the 'main' function to the value of the property you want the tax for. 

Pass the property value into the DisplayTaxDueForProperty method in the main function of 'main.go'. 

Enter the following:

go run .

You will now be presented with console output showing the tax due on the property. In the Â£200,000 property example already in the app, the final line of the console output would be the following:

**The tax due for the property valued at 200000.00 is 1100.00**

The lines above the final line are server log messages, and can be disregarded.

ASSUMPTIONS
===========

For the MVP, it will be assumed that:

- This app will only ever be for Scottish property tax.
- Rounding errors may occur
- The value of the property is a positive number <= 2,147,483,647.
- The only consideration when calculating the tax is the property value. 


POSSIBLE AVENUES FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
=======================================

- May get input from a user by a console or from localhost web page.
- Web scraping https://revenue.scot/taxes/land-buildings-transaction-tax/residential-property#residential%20property%20rates%20and%20bands to check that the app's bands reflect what's shown there. 
- Adding functionality to cater for other taxes - maybe Stamp Duty for other parts of the UK.
- Using a decimal library to avoid rounding errors.
